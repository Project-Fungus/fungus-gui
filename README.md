# electron-gui

Desktop GUI written using the Electron framework.

## Starting the App

Run
```
npm run start
```

## Linting

Run
```
npm run lint
```

## Testing the App

Run the app normally and then open one of the JSON files in `/test/` along with the `/test/projects/` directory. Play around and check that everything looks normal. Note that `unreadable-file.json` is meant to simulate what happens when the user tries to open a file that can't be read, so you should make sure you do *not* have permission to read it.
